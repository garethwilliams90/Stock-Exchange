# Stock-Exchange
This is a simple web appliation (built using flask) that uses IEX's API to take live stock market data and implement that into the buy, sell and quoting prices

This App was built with an SQLite3 database and used Jinja templating language for Python in HTML - the purpose of this exercise was to develop back-end skills and databse skills
as a oppose to front-end CSS HTML etc.
